## Instructions

### Installation

Put this mod in your `mods` folder. You also need to install [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) if you haven't installed it yet.

This mod also works on servers and require no client installation.

You can get the latest version [here](https://github.com/xwjcool123/BlockTunerMod/releases/latest) or find a specific release [here](https://github.com/xwjcool123/BlockTunerMod/releases)

### How to Use BlockTuner

`Ctrl` + `Right click` on a note block to open up tuning UI. Placing a note block while holding `Ctrl` also opens the UI automatically.

`Ctrl` to show the note of the note block at crosshair.

`Ctrl` + `Middle click` on note blocks to pick up readily tuned note blocks.

Right click note blocks with blaze rods to play with right clicks without tuning.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using BlockTuner 1.0.0 (Minecraft 1.18.2) or lower, you don't need to hold `Ctrl` to open up the tuning UI. Instead, use `/blocktuner` to toggle this.
> If you have Tweakeroo installed and have no access to the `Ctrl` key, please go to Tweakaroo configs, find `flexibleBlockPlacementOffset` under `Hot Keys` and set it to something else. e.g. `Right Alt`. Sorry for the inconvenience.

### Tuning UI

* ![](https://xwj.cool/img/blocktuner/btWidget2.png) Typing keyboard to piano keyboard - toggle whether you want to play the piano keyboard using your computer keyboard.
* ![](https://xwj.cool/img/blocktuner/btWidget3.png) MIDI Device - Click to cycle through available MIDI input devices. The icon shows red if the device is currently unavailable. This usually means it is being used by another program.
